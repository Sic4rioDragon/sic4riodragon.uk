    <!-- =================== TOS =================== -->
    <section id="tos">
      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p class="muted">Effective Date: <b>24 June 2025</b> · Last Updated: <b>10 September 2025</b></p>
      <p>By inviting and using our Discord bots (together, the “Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the bots.</p>
      <h3>This ToS covers:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>TAW DayZ Division Bot</b> (the “Activity Bot”) — formerly “TAW Activity Bot”</li>
        <li><b>TAW Division Ticket Bot</b> (the “Ticket Bot”)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1. Bot Usage</h3>
      <p><b>Activity Bot.</b> Tracks voice chat activity and can sync aggregated data to logs or external services (e.g., Google Sheets).</p>
      <p><b>Ticket Bot.</b> Enables support/recruit tickets in your server. By opening or participating in a ticket, you authorize the processing and storage of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ticket content (messages), participants, timestamps, and status changes</li>
        <li>Attachments uploaded to tickets</li>
        <li>Optional transcripts/archives for moderation and audit purposes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tickets may be auto-closed after a period of inactivity as configured by server admins.</p>
      <p><i>Misuse</i> (e.g., spamming, exploiting bugs, interfering with logging or ticket workflows) may result in removal of the bots from your server.</p>

      <h3>2. Deployment & Responsibility (Operator-Managed)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The bots are installed and configured exclusively by the operator <b>Sic4rioDragon</b> (and any authorized members of the bot team).</li>
        <li>We decide which servers the bots run in and manage all configuration (permissions, channels, retention, integrations).</li>
        <li>If we also administer/own the server, we handle user notices, disclosure, and configuration in line with this ToS and the Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>If the bots are deployed in a server we do not own (at that server’s request), that server’s owner remains responsible for any legal/user-notice obligations toward their members. We will provide links to this ToS/Privacy Policy and can supply template notices.</li>
        <li>The bots cannot verify individual user consent; we apply least-privilege configuration and limit collection to what’s necessary for bot features.</li>
        <li>Server owners may request removal of the bots by contacting us. We may also remove the bots at our discretion for safety, abuse, or operational reasons.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Acceptable Use</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Illegal content, malware, or attempts to bypass security</li>
        <li>Targeted harassment, doxxing, or other abusive content</li>
        <li>Sensitive personal data of third parties without clear consent</li>
        <li>Spam or irrelevant advertising; unsafe or infringing attachments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may restrict or remove access to protect users and communities.</p>

      <h3>4. Bot Availability</h3>
      <p>The Service is provided “as is”, with no guarantee of uptime or uninterrupted operation. We may update, suspend, or discontinue features at any time without notice, including to respect Discord API changes, rate limits, or safety concerns.</p>

      <h3>5. Third-Party & Storage Services</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Discord</b> APIs and CDN (message content, attachments, metadata)</li>
        <li><b>Optional</b> integrations configured by the server (e.g., Google Sheets exports)</li>
        <li><b>Optional</b> self-hosted storage used by the server owner for large files or archives</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your use of those services is governed by their respective terms and privacy practices.</p>
      <h3>6. Content & License</h3>
      <p>You retain rights to your own content. By submitting content through the bots (including ticket messages and attachments), you grant us and authorized server staff a non-exclusive license to <b>store, display, transmit, and process</b> that content within the server for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moderation and support workflows (including transcripts/archives)</li>
        <li>Bot functionality, troubleshooting, and abuse prevention</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You represent that you have the necessary rights to upload any content you submit.</p>

      <h3>7. Eligibility & Age Limits</h3>
      <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). The bots cannot verify individual user consent; server admins are responsible for appropriate configuration, transparency, and access controls.</p>

      <h3>8. Changes to the Terms</h3>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. The Last Updated date reflects the latest revision.</p>

      <h3>9. Termination</h3>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time for violations, abuse, security concerns, or to comply with legal/Discord requirements. You can remove the bots from your server at any time.</p>

      <h3>10. Contact</h3>
      <p>Questions: contact the owner on Discord — <b>Sic4rioDragon</b> (ID <span class="mono">422423016849408017</span>).</p>

      <h3>11. Operator Access & Audit (Invite Rights)</h3>
      <p>To maintain safety, troubleshoot issues, and verify compliance with these Terms and the Privacy Policy, the Operator reserves the right to request an invite link or direct invite to any server where the bots are deployed. At the Operator’s discretion (including for operational, safety, or other legitimate reasons), failure to provide reasonable audit access may result in the bots being disabled or removed from that server.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use minimal, least-privilege access and limit review to channels/logs relevant to bot operation (e.g., ticket channels created by the Ticket Bot).</li>
        <li>Use any information observed solely for safety, troubleshooting, and policy-compliance purposes, or as required by law.</li>
        <li>Not disclose server content obtained via audit except to enforce these Terms, protect users, or comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you prefer the bots to operate without Operator audit access, do not deploy the bots in your server.</p>

    <!-- =================== PRIVACY =================== -->
    <section id="privacy">
      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p class="muted">Effective Date: <b>24 June 2025</b> · Last Updated: <b>10 September 2025</b></p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy covers two Discord bots operated by <b>Sic4rioDragon</b> (the “Operator”):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>TAW DayZ Division Bot</b> (“Activity Bot”)</li>
        <li><b>TAW Division Ticket Bot</b> (“Ticket Bot”)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The bots are operator-managed. Only the Operator (and any authorized bot team members) deploys/configures them.</p>

      <h3>1) Who Controls Your Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For processing performed directly by the bots and for storage on the Operator’s infrastructure, the Operator is the data controller.</li>
        <li>If a server admin requests exports (e.g., Google Sheets) or maintains their own copies/archives, that admin may act as an independent controller for that exported data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) What We Collect</h3>
      <p><i>Common (both bots)</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discord identifiers: User ID, username, display name; Guild/Server ID, Channel ID, message/interaction IDs.</li>
        <li>Timestamps of interactions and technical diagnostics (uptime, rate limits, errors).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Activity Bot</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Voice state events (join/leave, channel IDs) and derived durations (lifetime / weekly / monthly minutes).</li>
        <li>Optional presence/game info only if explicitly enabled in configuration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Ticket Bot</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ticket content (messages in ticket channels or threads), ticket participants, timestamps, and status changes.</li>
        <li>Attachments uploaded within tickets (filename, size, MIME type, CDN URL or storage path).</li>
        <li>Transcripts/archives of tickets and moderation notes where enabled by admins.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not intentionally collect emails or real-world identifiers. Identification is via Discord accounts/IDs.</p>
      <h3>3) Why We Process Data (Legal Bases)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Legitimate interests</b>: operate support/moderation workflows; provide community features; prevent abuse; secure the service.</li>
        <li><b>Consent</b>: opening/participating in a ticket; using optional/opt-in features.</li>
        <li><b>Contract / Requested service</b>: responding to support requests and providing bot functions you ask for.</li>
        <li><b>Legal obligations</b>: responding to valid law-enforcement requests when required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4) How We Use Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve bot functionality.</li>
        <li>Calculate and display activity statistics (aggregated voice minutes, etc.).</li>
        <li>Operate ticket workflows, including transcripts/archives for authorized staff.</li>
        <li>Operator access for audit/troubleshooting (see ToS §11): limited to what’s necessary; least-privilege; not used for unrelated monitoring.</li>
        <li>Debugging, reliability, and safety (rate-limit handling, abuse/threat mitigation).</li>
        <li>Optional exports/sync (e.g., Google Sheets) or self-hosted storage if configured.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>We do not sell your data.</b> We share data only as described below.</p>

      <h3>5) Storage, Sharing, and Transfers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Storage</b>: local files/databases on the Operator’s server/infrastructure. Ticket attachments may reside on Discord CDN or self-hosted storage when configured.</li>
        <li><b>Sharing</b>: with Discord (APIs/CDN); authorized server staff for moderation/support; Google only if a server/admin enables Sheets syncing; and hosting providers used by the Operator.</li>
        <li><b>No advertising sharing</b>: we do not share with advertisers or data brokers.</li>
        <li><b>Transfers</b>: providers may process data outside your country. We rely on the providers’ contractual safeguards where applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6) Retention</h3>
      <p>Defaults (may be adjusted per-server/config):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Activity aggregates: retained while the feature is active or until purged by admin request.</li>
        <li>Ticket transcripts: up to <b>24 months</b>.</li>
        <li>Ticket attachments: up to <b>180 days</b>, or subject to Discord CDN availability.</li>
        <li>Technical logs: up to <b>90 days</b>, unless needed longer for security/debugging.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Minimal records may be kept to honor opt-out or deletion requests.</p>

      <h3>7) Your Rights</h3>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object, and port your data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requests require verification via your Discord account (we may ask for your User ID and the server name/ID).</li>
        <li>If data is stored/exported by a server admin, we may direct you to that admin for those copies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8) Security</h3>
      <p>We apply reasonable measures for a small, self-hosted project: token protection, least-privilege permissions, limited access, and logging controls. No system is 100% secure.</p>

      <h3>9) Children</h3>
      <p>The bots are not intended for users under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe we unintentionally processed such data, contact us to delete it.</p>

      <h3>10) Changes to this Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this Policy. Material changes will be reflected by the Last Updated date above.</p>
